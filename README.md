# Chai (Chain of Models and Actions)

Chai is an AI agent orchestration tool that enables the composition of Large Language Model (LLM) operations using a YAML-based Domain Specific Language (DSL). It acts as an agent manager, allowing you to create, coordinate and control multiple AI agents working together to accomplish complex tasks.

Think of each step in a YAML file as an individual agent with specific capabilities. You can chain these agents together to create more sophisticated agent networks that collaborate to solve problems.

Create YAML 'agent recipes' and use `Chai process` to deploy and execute your agent workflows.

Chai allows you to leverage different AI agents from multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, X.AI, Ollama) and compose agent pipelines that combine their unique strengths. It provides an extensible DSL for defining complex multi-agent workflows and interactions.
